# Advanced-Computer-Vision-myTasks
This repository consists of a bunch of computer vision tasks from my Coursera course 'Advanced Computer Vision with TensorFlow', wherein I tried my hands on feature extraction on various levels (especially for Object detection and localization) using some built-in APIs as well as lambda layers/loss-functions/classifiers, in Tensorflow framework - Keras libraries. 
Please feel free to look around.
