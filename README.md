# Advanced-Computer-Vision-myTasks
This repository consists of a bunch of computer vision tasks from my Coursera course 'Advanced Computer Vision with TensorFlow', wherein I tried my hands on Meticulous feature extraction using some built-in APIs as well as my own custom deep neural networks(specially on Image data), in Tensorflow framework - Keras libraries. 
Please feel free to look around.
