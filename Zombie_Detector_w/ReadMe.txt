The results.data file includes the predicted bounding boxes of the zombie detector, which can be compared against the reference boxes generated by a well trained model. Model performance is computed based on the proportion of boxes that matched the reference boxes with a relative tolerance of 0.3. Considering model sanity, at least a 70% proportion is required.

A whopping 99% proportion-match with ground-truth bounding-box is obtained after apt. fine-tuining!
